iolab - I/O Experimentation Laboratory
================================================================================

This repository contains a set of I/O experiments that demonstrate different
aspects of parallel I/O performance and parallel file systems.

It is also a dumping ground for clever I/O benchmark input decks and analysis
scripts so I don't forget them in the future.
